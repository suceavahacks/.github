## 🎯 About us

Suceava Hacks is a local initiative run by students who are passionate about tech, learning, and building things that matter.  
We organize events, meetups, and workshops where high schoolers can explore programming, cybersecurity, and other areas of technology in a friendly and supportive environment.

Our goal is simple: help people get started, improve together, and build cool stuff along the way.
